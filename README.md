# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my brief study guide on the prework for the Front-end Development Bootcamp. Programming is a challenging journey, especially for beginners. This page helps students by presenting the main concepts in one place. They can easily navigate through the main topics and have the key info at hand whenever they need a reminder about a certain definition or element. By creating this simple yet interractive page, I made my first steps in programming.
